* inner_product     New system function to calculate inner distance between vectors
* negative_inner_product
                    New system function to calculate neg ip distance between vectors
* ST_GeomFromText   GIS function: parse text to geometry object
* st_distance       GIS function: calculate distance between Points
* st_dwithin        GIS function: check if the distance between two points
* st_astext         GIS function: return a Point in human-readable format
* ReplaceStmt       Replace into statement based on the extension of SQLAlchemy.Insert
* FtsIndex          Full Text Search Index
